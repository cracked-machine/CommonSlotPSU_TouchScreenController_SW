Optimized_STM32_ILI9341

Version 1.0

This project contains a modified and optimised version of the STM32-ILI9341 library.

- Optimized to use direct-to-register SPI for single- and multi-byte transfers (MOSI only). This offers a noticeable performance boost over HAL API.
- Draw functions were modified to use x,y,width,height parameters.
- Additional draw functions from STMBasicGUI were included.

### Definitions in "ILI9341_STM32_Driver.h"

Use SPI1 as the serial commm peripheral in your design.
Define the RST/CS/DC pin names in the GPIO section of CubeMX.

### Test Code

  ILI9341_Init();
  ILI9341_Set_Rotation(SCREEN_HORIZONTAL_1);
  ILI9341_Fill_Screen(BLUE);
  ILI9341_Draw_Text("TEST", 10, 10, BLACK, 2, RED);
